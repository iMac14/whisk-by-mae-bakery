# TODO for Fixing admin/orders.php

- [x] Update SQL queries for pending_orders, accepted_orders, and done_orders to include u.address in SELECT statement
- [x] Replace Pending Orders section with Bootstrap table (columns: Order ID, Customer Name, Email, Address, Items, Total, Ordered On, Actions)
- [x] Replace Accepted Orders section with Bootstrap table (same columns)
- [x] Replace Done Orders section with Bootstrap table (same columns, no Actions column)
- [x] Test the page at http://localhost/whiskbymae/admin/orders.php for correct display and responsiveness
